-- Thank you for using my script. If you like it recommend me. Special Thanks to superyu'#7167 who helped me with the auto updates. Also some of the Spams are copied but I can't find the source.

-- Hit me up on discord to request new features and maybe I add them.

-- If you want to add your own Spams just add them in a new line below, but make sure you have a "," above.
